# ClientDataBaseApplication
A proof of concept application that uses tkinter as UI and allows for adding, deleting, importing and exporting one or many clients to be displayed of their Name, Phone Number, Address.

Thanks for Checking out my Projects, This was a really fun one, to learn how to make some simple UI using the tkinter and customtkinter,
this was my first project where the use for classes really clicked for me, the simple analogy of making a person class with attributes of 
height and weight makes sense, but the bulk of the program was built with class and methods which comparing to doing it with just functions, 
made this project so much easier.

I Added notation to the ClientApplication.py, and Classes.py to share my thoughts and what is going on

The program is stable and should be able to be tested from the ClientApplications.py as long as you have the entire folder

NOTE: the ClientsDataBase.csv is not the storage file for the program just a test import and export feature for the program, the client storage-
is done with the pickle(pkl) file
